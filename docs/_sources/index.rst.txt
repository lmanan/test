Welcome to Cellulus
===================

**Cellulus** is an unsupervised, deep learning approach for performing instance segmentation in biomedical microscopy data. No ground truth annotations are needed for training the model.

This work was accepted to the International Conference for Computer Vision (ICCV 2023, Paris) and is available `here <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Wolf_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Object-Centric_Embeddings_for_Cell_Instance_Segmentation_in_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf>`_.
